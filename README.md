AP CS notes for LS PC - notes for students who already know how to program

Put notes in a text editor like Sublime Text 2 or Vim, and turn on syntax highlighting, for the best possible formatting. Much of the notes consists of code (I find that people who already know how to program work best with Java if they have examples of the different concepts), so a syntax highlighter is really useful.
