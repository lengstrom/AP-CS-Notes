AP-CS-Notes
===========

AP CS notes for the LS Programming Club. One should have some knowledge of programming before reading these.

For the best possible formatting, put notes in a text editor (like Sublime Text 2 or Vim) and turn on syntax highlighting. Code makes up much of the notes, so a syntax highlighter is very useful.

Some chapters are in .md format - read those on GitHub or using your favorite markdown viewer (I use Mou).
