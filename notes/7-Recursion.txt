// Recursive methods
// Recursive method is a method that calls itself

// Two distinct pairs
	// Base case or termination that causes the method to end
	// nonbase case whose actions move the algorithm towards the base case and thus termination

// Tail recursion: no statements follow the recursive call
// Basically just do problems based on recursion. there's really not much you can do other than just get more intuition about them.
